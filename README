Acknowledgements: 

COMP40 Professors, for teaching and giving lectures about relevant topics
David R. Hanson, for providing the base data structures needed for this
assignment. (Sequences)


Implementation:

um.c - Contains the entire UM implementation profiled and optimized for 
maximum performance.

README - This file.


Final UM Analysis:

On midmark, Seq_get takes up most of the time by far, over 20% as reported by 
kcachegrind. This is primarily due to the number of times it is used during 
benchmarking, as it is central to all memory operations. Because Seq_get is
a Hanson implementation, the assembly code cannot be improved as we cannot
change the implementation of these functions.


Time Spent:
